## ⚡ START HERE — handoff for the next session (updated 2026-08-31 late, S4)

**Martin skis at Portillo on 2026-09-01 and this is the first outdoor recording.** The app is
installed, current, and now survives being killed mid-day. The single open question is still
whether GPS behaves outdoors.

### The first thing to do next session

**Pull the day's file and look at it.** Everything else is secondary — this is the first real
data the project has ever had.

```sh
xcrun devicectl device copy from --device 270B9EDA-7298-5206-9E67-71C0E8F60CF6 \
  --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.gamberg.vertical \
  --source Documents/Sessions --destination ~/Desktop/Projects/Vertical/Data/pull-$(date +%Y%m%d)
~/Desktop/Projects/Vertical/Tools/analyze.py <the new file>.jsonl
```

Read, in this order: **the Doppler ratio** (the whole max-speed approach depends on it), then the
GPS fix rate, then vertical run-segmented vs. the naive methods, then the battery notes, then the
hand-placed tags. If the report says the session auto-resumed, that means the app died and
recovered — note the gap and why (battery? thermal? jetsam?).

Two test files from the S4 verification are on the phone and will show up in the pull:
`2026-08-31_230847_TESTRESU.jsonl` and `2026-08-31_231638_TESTRES2.jsonl`. **Both are synthetic —
delete them.** They are closed with an `end` record so they cannot auto-resume.

### If the build has expired

Free provisioning lasts 7 days; reinstalled **2026-08-31 23:24**, so it dies around
**2026-09-07**. If the app won't launch, rebuild + reinstall:
   ```sh
   cd ~/Desktop/Projects/Vertical/iOS
   xcodebuild -project Vertical.xcodeproj -scheme Vertical -configuration Debug \
     -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -allowProvisioningUpdates build
   xcrun devicectl device install app --device 270B9EDA-7298-5206-9E67-71C0E8F60CF6 \
     ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Vertical-hhltzbilrpjrdxgsdbemtrfnvlhq/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Vertical.app
   ```
Note the destination must be a **file path, not a directory**, when copying a single file —
`copy from ... --destination somedir/` fails with a bare "Is a directory" I/O error.

### Verified working (measured on Martin's iPhone 17, not assumed)

- **Auto-resume after the app is killed mid-session** (S4). Verified by planting an interrupted
  session with a torn final line, `SIGKILL`ing the process and relaunching: it reopened the same
  file on the same `dt` timeline, reported a 301 s gap, and restored the sample counts. A
  cleanly-closed session is correctly left alone.

- Recording, clean session close, files on disk, `devicectl` pull path.
- Location authorization is **Always** (`auth=3` in the log).
- **The barometer is excellent.** 184 samples at ~0.9 Hz, **zero gaps > 5 s**.
  **Noise floor: 0.85 m total drift over 3.2 min stationary.** With 3 m hysteresis the analyzer
  reports exactly 0 m of phantom descent.
- Barometric pressure read 72.359 kPa ≈ **2,880 m, which matches Portillo's base elevation** — so
  the sensor is not just stable but correct.
- Over the same stationary 3.2 min, **GPS altitude accumulated 10 m of phantom vertical.** That
  ratio, on real hardware, is the project thesis in miniature.

### ⚠️ THE ONE OPEN QUESTION — GPS health outdoors

The only smoke test so far was **indoors**, and it showed:
- GPS at **0.34 Hz** (a fix every 5–6 s, suspiciously regular) instead of ~1 Hz
- **Doppler speed valid on only 8 of 68 fixes** (`speed = -1` on the rest)
- horizontal accuracy median ±12 m

Indoors this is all expected. But **Doppler speed is the single field the entire max-speed
approach rests on**, and it has never been observed working on this device. Martin couldn't test
outdoors (it's cold and Portillo has nowhere to walk), so **the first chairlift is the test.**

A live **`DOPPLER` tile** was added to the UI precisely for this — it shows valid/total, colour
coded (green ≥80%, yellow ≥40%, orange below). Ask Martin what colour it showed.

- **Green outdoors** → GPS is fine, proceed to Phase 1 analysis work.
- **Still orange while moving outdoors** → the CoreLocation configuration is wrong, not the
  environment. Investigate `activityType` (currently `.other`), `desiredAccuracy`
  (`kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation`), and whether iOS is throttling background updates.
  **Do not let him record many days before resolving this.**

### Design correction from Martin (2026-08-31) — important

> "on slope, you do not need to press 'top' and 'bottom' or lift. it identifies them
> automatically. You only press start."

He is right, and the shipped app must work that way. **The tag buttons are temporary scaffolding,
not the product** — they exist only to produce hand-labelled ground truth for building and
validating the auto-detector. Tags are **optional** for him and must never interfere with skiing.
Once run/lift detection is accurate, remove the buttons from the UI.

This was my framing error, not his misunderstanding — worth not repeating.

### Also from Martin: Strava's 3D map is a design reference

He likes Strava's map and specifically its 3D. Relevant to the §9.1 renderer spike — and note
Strava absorbed FATMAP's technology (see `RESEARCH.md` §3.3). Worth looking at directly before
choosing an approach.

## Current state — S1 (2026-08-31)

**Research only. No code, no repo, no Xcode project yet.**

What S1 established:
- Full competitive landscape mapped (`RESEARCH.md` §2).
- **8 of Slopes' 10 premium features are free to build with no running cost** (§8).
- **Trail maps are solved** — OpenSkiMap ships 6,992 ski areas / 96,693 runs as daily GeoJSON +
  vector tiles under ODbL. That's ~140× Slopes' ~50 hand-crafted resorts.
- **Live lift status is solved** — Liftie (BSD-3, actively maintained) with a public REST API. This
  was the feature I initially assessed as the expensive one; it isn't.
- **The wedge is accuracy, not features** — the whole category has documented 5–10% vertical
  overestimation and ~10 mph max-speed error, and nobody has fixed it (§5.1, §10).
- **One real technical blocker found**: MapLibre Native has no 3D terrain on iOS yet (§9.1). This
  invalidates the obvious "just use MapLibre" plan for the 3D feature and needs a spike.
- Two features to cut from v1: **AR replay** (won't georeference on a mountain, lowest value) and
  **Apple Watch** (a reliability liability — it's where Slopes' 1★ reviews come from).

## Blocked on Martin — decide before Phase 1

These are in `RESEARCH.md` §11 in full. The three that actually gate work:

| # | Decision | Why it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **iOS-only first?** | Everything. (iOS plays to Yomi experience; Android is where Slopes is measurably weakest.) |
| D2 | **Social/backend in scope?** | Determines whether this is a zero-cost on-device app or a service with hosting, accounts, and a bill. |
| D3 | **Where + when is the first real snow test?** | It's late August. Northern season is ~3 months out; southern (Bariloche / Los Andes) is in season *now* through Sept–Oct. This sets the whole schedule. |

D4 (the 3D renderer) does **not** block Phase 1 — it's a Phase 3 spike.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations

- [ ] Settle D1–D3 above; pick a real name.
- [ ] `git init`, GitHub repo, Xcode project, `CLAUDE.md` finalised.
- [ ] **Install and actually use the competitors** — Slopes free tier, Ski Tracks, Open Ski Map.
      Yomi's S114 lesson: hands-on surfaces what reading never does.
- [ ] Re-run community research in-season (see `CLAUDE.md` → Tooling → `last30days`).

## Phase 1 — The recording engine (the whole bet lives here)

This is not the boring part. This is the product.

**Done as of S2–S3:** background recording with correct entitlements, crash-safe append-only
store, raw capture of every CoreLocation + barometer field, live diagnostics, on-device install.
**Not started:** everything below that isn't ticked — all the actual maths.

> **Auto-detection is a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have.** The user presses START and pockets
> the phone; the app works out lifts and runs by itself. Slopes does this and it is the baseline
> expectation for the category. The tag buttons currently in the UI are scaffolding for building
> that detector and must be removed once it works.

- [ ] `CoreLocation` background recording, correct entitlements + privacy manifest.
- [ ] **Crash-safe append-only track store.** Every sample hits disk as it arrives. A kill, crash,
      or dead battery loses one sample, and recovery on next launch is silent — never a "resume or
      finish?" prompt. (Directly targets the 1★ reviews in `RESEARCH.md` §5.2.)
- [ ] **Barometric + GPS altitude fusion** (`CMAltimeter`), drift-corrected over long windows so
      weather pressure change doesn't inflate vertical.
- [ ] **Doppler max speed** from `CLLocation.speed` with `speedAccuracy` gating. Never differentiate
      positions. (Targets the "+10 mph" bug.)
- [ ] **Automatic lift vs. run segmentation** — sustained ascent + proximity to `aerialway`
      geometry. Zero user interaction. Validate against the hand-placed tags in recorded sessions.
      Portillo's *va-et-vient* slingshot platter lifts are an unusual edge case worth checking:
      they won't look like a chairlift to a naive detector.
- [ ] **Adaptive sampling** — high rate on descent, low on lift. Fixes both battery *and* the
      "faster skiing records less vertical" artefact at once.
- [ ] Per-run stats; average speed over **descent time only**, excluding lifts and lift lines.
- [ ] **Accuracy harness** — replay recorded GPX/raw-sample fixtures through the pipeline in tests,
      so accuracy work is measurable and can't silently regress. Build this *with* the engine.

**Phase 1 exit criterion:** a real recorded ski day whose vertical and max speed we can defend
against a known reference, with the error quantified.

## Phase 2 — Maps

- [ ] Ingest OpenSkiMap data; per-resort offline packs (a resort is a few MB).
- [ ] 2D vector map with runs coloured by difficulty, lifts, run names — **all unpaywalled**.
- [ ] Search trails by name / difficulty.
- [ ] ODbL attribution surface, correctly placed.
- [ ] Track drawn over the map; run replay with speed heatmap; scrubber.

## Phase 3 — 3D (spike first, commit second)

- [ ] **Spike all four options** from `RESEARCH.md` §9.1 — MapKit, MapLibre-2D-now-3D-later,
      SceneKit/RealityKit from DEM, MapLibre GL JS in `WKWebView`. Then decide. Do not pick from
      the armchair.

## Phase 4 — Lift status

- [ ] **Contact the Liftie maintainer before pointing anything at `liftie.info`.** Non-negotiable.
- [ ] Self-host Liftie or consume the API; contribute resort adapters upstream.
- [ ] Be honest in the UI about which resorts have live data and how stale it is. Never render a
      stale report as if it were live.
- [ ] Grooming: partial coverage at best. Treat as best-effort, not a promise.

## Phase 5 — Retention

- [ ] Season + lifetime totals (the actual retention hook per `RESEARCH.md` §4).
- [ ] End-of-season recap.
- [ ] Run comparisons: you vs. you.
- [ ] Sunlight-readable, glove-usable design pass. High contrast is a *functional* requirement here.

## Backlog — unserved requests worth stealing (`RESEARCH.md` §6)

- Gear quiver tracking (log skis/bindings/boots per day, days-on-gear, wax/tune reminders) — asked for, served by nobody
- Average run pitch/angle as a first-class stat
- Trail/lift **closures**, not just openings
- Turn/edge-change count from the gyroscope — genuinely novel
- **Show error bars on stats.** A category first, and it makes the accuracy work legible to users
- **GPX import from other ski apps** — stolen from Carve (`RESEARCH.md` §2.2). Cheap, and it means
  a switcher arrives with their history instead of an empty season total

## Explicitly out of scope for v1

- AR replay — `ARGeoTrackingConfiguration` doesn't cover ski resorts; lowest value on the list
- Apple Watch — reliability liability, see `RESEARCH.md` §9.5
- Social graph / friend-finding — network effects favour the incumbent, and Slopes gives it away free anyway
- Competing on human support responsiveness — a 12-person company wins that; don't play

## Session log

### S4 — 2026-08-31 (late) · made the app survive a full day, and found a real peer

Purpose of the session: **tomorrow is the first outdoor recording, so make the thing that would
waste it impossible.** The pulled recordings confirmed no outdoor data existed yet — the newest
file was 20:38, indoors and stationary — so the GPS question is still open and untouched.

**The gap that mattered.** `SampleWriter`'s own documentation promised that an interrupted file
"can be picked up silently on next launch". Nothing implemented it. A jetsam kill in a pocket or
a cold-weather cut-off would have brought the app back **IDLE** while Martin kept skiing. Built
`SessionRecovery` + `TrackRecorder.resumeIfInterrupted()`: on every launch, foreground or
background, an `end`-less session that stopped within six hours is silently reopened and appended
to on the same timeline. No prompt — a "resume or finish?" question tapped wrong on a chairlift is
what triples other apps' totals — just a green banner saying it happened. Significant-location-
change monitoring is registered while recording solely because it is the only API that asks iOS
to relaunch a terminated app.

Two correctness bugs fell out of building it:

- `SampleWriter` called `createFile` unconditionally, and `createFile` **truncates**. Reopening a
  recording would have erased the recording. It now creates only when absent, and closes off a
  torn final line so a power cut costs one record rather than two.
- **`CMAltimeter.relativeAltitude` restarts from zero at every resume.** Summing deltas across
  that seam invents vertical. Demonstrated with a synthetic day where the phone dies at the top of
  a lift: the analyzer reported **800 m for a 400 m descent**, a 100 % overstatement — the exact
  category bug this project exists to fix, reproduced in our own code. The analyzer now marks
  resume seams and measures each stretch separately; 400 m exactly. Vertical skied while the app
  was dead is reported as unknown, never guessed.

**Verified on hardware, not just compiled** — planted an interrupted session, `SIGKILL`ed the
process, relaunched, watched it recover; then confirmed a closed session is left alone. The first
attempt at that second check *falsely passed as a failure*: the probe searched for the literal
`"t":"end"`, and the Python-written fixture had `"t": "end"` with a space. `JSONEncoder` never
emits that space, so real files were always fine — but a recovery check that silently decides a
finished session is still running is not something to leave resting on byte-exact formatting. The
field reader is now whitespace-tolerant. **The lesson is the older one restated: a test fixture
that isn't byte-identical to production output tests the fixture.**

**Carve.** Martin asked about an ad for "Carver". It is
[Carve: Ski & Snowboard](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/carve-ski-snowboard/id6758206264) — a
solo-dev, free, no-paywall, donation-funded ski tracker that already ships auto lift detection,
3D terrain replay with satellite drape, speed heatmaps, run comparison and GPX import. Written up
in `RESEARCH.md` §2.2. It makes §2.1's "unoccupied position" claim wrong as written, and it makes
the accuracy thesis the only load-bearing part of this project — it claims nothing about accuracy
anywhere. It also proves 3D terrain on iOS is solo-dev-reachable, which de-risks §9.1 / D4.

---

### S3 — 2026-08-31 · shipped to the device, first real data, two bugs found
Signing sorted: Xcode had **no Apple ID signed in at all** (which is why Yomi has never run on a
device — simulator only). After Martin signed in, the real team ID turned out to be `F9R33MN82P`,
read from the certificate's `organizationalUnitName` — my earlier guess of `8RNGM77QFU` was the
certificate's own ID, not the team. Xcode's GUI handled DDI mount + device registration after
`xcodebuild` couldn't.

**Crash on START, root-caused and fixed.** `INFOPLIST_KEY_UIBackgroundModes` is **silently ignored
by Xcode's Info.plist generator** — no warning, the key just never reaches the build. Without the
`location` background mode, `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true` raises an uncatchable ObjC
exception. Checking the built binary the same way found `INFOPLIST_KEY_UIFileSharingEnabled` had
vanished too. Both now come from a real base plist (`Vertical-Info.plist`) merged under
`GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE`. Added a runtime guard so a missing background mode degrades to
foreground-only with a visible warning rather than crashing.

**Lesson, generalised:** verify Info.plist keys by reading them out of the *built product*, never
by trusting that a build setting was honoured. Same family as Yomi's S118 build-settings trap.

**First real recording** (3.2 min, indoors, stationary) gave the numbers in the handoff above:
barometer excellent and correct, GPS unproven. Three follow-up fixes shipped: live `DOPPLER`
health tile, visible tag confirmation (the log showed three "Top" taps in three seconds because
nothing acknowledged the first), and analyzer exclusion of pre-start cached fixes.

Martin corrected the interaction model — auto-detection, not manual tagging. Captured above.

---

### S2 — 2026-08-31 · decisions settled, recorder built
**Martin is at Ski Portillo, Chile, for the week.** That inverts the plan: raw capture is now
urgent, everything else can wait. Decisions: **D1 iOS-only ✓**, **D2 social deferred** ("whatever
is easier" — so on-device only, zero running cost), **D3 Portillo, this week**.

Built a deliberately minimal recorder — Xcode project, `TrackRecorder`, `SampleWriter`,
recording UI, sessions list. Compiles zero-error zero-warning. **It does no analysis at all**: it
appends every `CLLocation` and barometer sample to JSONL at full fidelity, fsync'd, append-only,
so a crash or dead battery costs a few samples and never asks a "resume or finish?" question.
The reasoning: analysis can be rewritten and replayed all week against real files; a day skied
without capture is gone forever.

Also built `Tools/analyze.py` — the accuracy harness. Computes vertical four ways and max speed
two ways on the same data, so the project thesis becomes measurable rather than asserted.
Validated on synthetic data (recovered 1,399 m from a 1,400 m ground truth; 4/4 runs matched
hand markers). **Its error magnitudes on synthetic data are inflated** — synthetic noise is
independent per-sample, real GPS noise is correlated. Real magnitudes pending real data.

One build-settings trap hit and fixed, exactly as [[project-yomi]] S118 warned: with
`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`, the plain data structs got MainActor-isolated
`Encodable` conformances and couldn't satisfy a `Sendable` requirement. Fixed by marking them
`nonisolated`.

**Blocked on Martin:** Developer Mode is disabled on the iPhone 17 (Settings → Privacy &
Security → Developer Mode, then reboot). Nothing installs until then. Build is ready and waiting.


### S1 — 2026-08-31 · market + feasibility research
Martin asked for a ski app with Slopes' premium features free, then redirected to research and
planning first. Swept App Store review feeds, ski forums, comparison blogs, GitHub, the Slopes
founder's own dev blog, and MapLibre release notes. Wrote `RESEARCH.md`, this file, and `CLAUDE.md`.
No code. Headline findings in "Current state" above. Three decisions (D1–D3) handed back to Martin.
